This is a "preview" version of APLS.
We have uploaded **all remaining transcript series**; however, we are still tweaking transcript data and refining the UI, so the data is subject to change in minor ways.


#### Data updates: LV10
{:.no_toc}

Previously, audio files in the `LV10` <span class="layer">episode</span> had two channels: both participants (interviewer and interviewee) on the left channel and static on the right channel.
(This is in contrast to most transcripts, where the interviewer and interviewee are on [separate channels]({{ '/doc/view-transcript#audio-channels' | relative_url }}).)
The <span class="layer">segment</span> alignments for the participant `LV10` were also rather poor.
As a result, we have deleted the right channel (so that `LV10` audio files are now in mono) and rerun forced-alignment for `LV10`.
`LV10`'s <span class="layer">segment</span> alignments are much better now, and more of `LV10`'s utterances have been aligned:

| Layer | Annotations in 0.4.2 | Annotations in 0.4.3 | Change |
|-------|---------------------:|---------------------:|-------:|
| <span class="layer">htk</span> (aligned utterances) | 521 | 546 | +25 |
| <span class="layer">segment</span> | 18,533 | 20,219 | +1,686 |
| <span class="layer">phonemes</span> | 5,607 | 6,118 | +511 |
| <span class="layer">syllables</span> | 7,206 | 7,861 | +655 |
| <span class="layer">stress</span> | 7,206 | 7,861 | +655 |
| <span class="layer">foll_pause</span> | 5,587 | 6,110 | +523 |
| <span class="layer">foll_segment</span> | 18,503 | 20,211 | +1,708 |
| <span class="layer">speech_rate</span> | 533 | 556 | +23 |


#### New layers/attributes
{:.no_toc}

- Added new transcript attributes corresponding to which participant(s) are on which audio channel(s): <span class="transcript-attr">left_channel_participants</span>, <span class="transcript-attr">right_channel_participants</span>, <span class="transcript-attr">single_channel_participants</span>

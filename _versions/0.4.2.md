This is a "preview" version of APLS.
We have uploaded **all remaining transcript series**; however, we are still tweaking transcript data and refining the UI, so the data is subject to change in minor ways.


#### New layers/attributes
{:.no_toc}

- Added a new <span class="participant-attr">race</span> attribute.
- Moved <span class="layer">dictionary_phonemes</span> from the 'phonology' [project]({{ '/doc/layer-typology#project' | relative_url }}) to the 'temp' project to avoid confusion with <span class="layer">phonemes</span>, which is probably what users are more interested in for viewing, searching, and extracting data.
  - As a result, version 0.4.2 lists one fewer annotation layer than [version 0.4.0](#status-0.4.0), since this count excludes 'temp' layers.

#### User interface changes
{:.no_toc}

- The user interface has been updated in line with the latest version of LaBB-CAT, plus some APLS-specific tweaks.

#### Third-party software
{:.no_toc}

- [Praat] has been updated to the latest version (6.4.47 for Windows).

#### Other
{:.no_toc}

- The server that APLS runs on has received upgrades to memory and computational power.

This is a "preview" version of APLS.
We are still adding new transcripts and refining the UI, so the data is subject to change in minor ways.


#### User interface changes
{:.no_toc}

- The <span class="apls-page">Search results</span> page [now includes information]({{ '/doc/user-interface#matches-headline' | relative_url }}) about how long it took APLS to retrieve the matches for that search. This is useful for benchmarking APLS's performance and determining [whether it's running slower than usual]({{ '/doc/troubleshooting#apls-is-slow' | relative_url }}).


#### Layer data updates
{:.no_toc}

Due to suspected duplicate annotations, all CELEX-based layers were regenerated: <span class="layer">frequency_from_celex</span>, <span class="layer">lemma</span>, and <span class="layer">morphemes</span>.
This revealed duplicates in the first two layers, with the vast majority in two interviews (CB10interview2.eaf and CB10interview5.eaf).
The changes are summarized below (note that all three layers allow [vertical peers]({{ '/doc/layer-typology#vertical-peers' | relative_url }}), so their annotation counts are greater than <span class="layer">orthography</span>).

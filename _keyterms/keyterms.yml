    In APLS, each transcript corresponds to part of a sociolinguistic interview with a single interviewee.
    Interviews are split into transcripts according to the original recording files.
    
    Transcripts are named with the interviewee's speaker code, the interview section, an optional numeric suffix if that interview section took up more than recording file, and `.eaf` (the [Elan][] transcription file format).
    
    Transcripts can be viewed on [transcript pages](doc/view-transcript).

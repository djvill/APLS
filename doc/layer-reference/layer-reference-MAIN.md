<span class="keyterm">Layers</span> are the backbone of what makes APLS so powerful.
They organize <span class="keyterm">annotations</span> into structured linguistic data, allowing you to [search]({{ '/doc/search' | relative_url }}) the corpus for complex patterns and [export]({{ '/doc/export-data' | relative_url }}) information about linguistic phenomena.
Since layers belong to <span class="keyterm">transcripts</span>, you can see layer annotations in context when you [view a transcript]({{ '/doc/view-transcript' | relative_url }}).
([As a reminder]({{ '/doc/getting-started#special-formatting' | relative_url }}), text formatted with a dotted underline, like <span class="layer">dictionary_phonemes</span>, refers to a layer name.)
<!-- Layers also come from a variety of sources: manual annotations when audio files are first [transcribed]({{ '/doc/transcription' | relative_url }}), predefined lexicons, and machine-learning algorithms designed for specialized linguistic annotation tasks. -->

The pages in this section break down how layers work:

1. A [typology of layers]({{ '/doc/typology' | relative_url }}) with the fundamentals of how layers work, such as the difference between <span class="keyterm">word layers</span> and <span class="keyterm">segment layers</span>.
1. A [detailed layer field-guide]({{ '/doc/detailed-field-guide' | relative_url }}) that contains all the information you need to know about each layer.
1. A rundown of [notation systems]({{ '/doc/notation-systems' | relative_url }}) so you can decode the symbols that different layers use, such as the [DISC phonemic alphabet]({{ '/doc/notation-systems#disc-phonemic-alphabet' | relative_url }}).
1. A [quick reference card]({{ '/doc/quick-reference-card' | relative_url }}) that is useful for refreshing your memory about how each layer works.

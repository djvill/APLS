APLS contains audio recordings of one-on-one [sociolinguistic interviews](https://languageandlife.org/about-sociolinguistics/) from fieldwork conducted in 2003--2005 with native Pittsburghers in four Pittsburgh neighborhoods: the Hill District (abbreviated `HD` in APLS), Lawrenceville (`LV`), Forest Hills (`FH`), and Cranberry Township (`CB`).[^neighborhood]
(This fieldwork was led by Barbara Johnstone and Scott Kiesling.)
These interviews typically consisted of several sections (though not all interviews had all of these):

- A long conversation
  - Sometimes including chatter about "Pittsburghese" and/or African American English
- 1--2 reading tasks
- A [minimal pairs task](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics2/chapter/10-5-variationist-methods-and-concepts/)

[^neighborhood]: In keeping with Pittsburgh parlance, we use _neighborhood_ to encompass geographic areas inside or outside Pittsburgh city limits. Technically, only the Hill District and Lawrenceville are within city limits. Forest Hills is a borough within Allegheny County, and Cranberry Township is a township just outside Allegheny County. In the original fieldwork, these sites were chosen to reflect a distinction (between inner-city, inner-ring suburb, and outer-ring suburb) that shows up in some classic sociolinguistic literature (e.g., [Bailey et al. 1993](https://doi.org/10.1017/S095439450000154X), [Eckert 2000](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Language+Variation+as+Social+Practice%3A+The+Linguistic+Construction+of+Identity+in+Belten+High-p-9780631186038))

APLS includes just a subset of the audio files from this fieldwork.
All interviewees in APLS are natives of the Pittsburgh area, and all interviewees consented to make their data publicly available.
In addition, APLS currently contains only files that had just one interviewee.
For more information about how these files turned into the structured linguistic data in APLS, see [this page]({{ '/doc/data-sources' | relative_url }}).

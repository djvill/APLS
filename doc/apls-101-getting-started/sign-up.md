Once you have an APLS login, you can access APLS through your browser at <https://apls.pitt.edu/labbcat>.[^r-python]

[^r-python]: Advanced users can also access APLS via the [`nzilbb.labbcat` package][labbcat-R] for R, or the [`nzilbb-labbcat` library][labbcat-py] for Python. These packages have most of the functionality of the browser-based graphical user interface (https://apls.pitt.edu/labbcat), with some added benefits such as reproducibility (e.g., a particular set of [search]({{ '/doc/search' | relative_url }}) criteria can be encoded in R/Python code rather than described for copy/paste). Even if you plan to mostly use these interfaces, however, it's a good idea to learn the browser-based GUI first, as it will help you build an intuitive sense for how APLS data is organized.

## Request a user account

Request a user account [here][sign up]{: target="_blank"}.
(Don't worry, we'll approve your request! It's just the way our registration system is set up.)
We'll send you a username and temporary password within 1 US business day.


## Read the terms of use

While you wait for your username and temporary password, you can read the [terms of use]({{ '/doc/terms' | relative_url }}).
When you first log in to APLS, you'll be asked to agree to these terms.


## Initial login

Once you have a username and temporary password, you can log in to <https://apls.pitt.edu/labbcat>:

![]({{ '/assets/screengrab/login.png' | relative_url }})

There are two additional things you'll only need to do the **first** time you log in:

1. You'll see a page with the terms of use (identical to the [terms of use page]({{ '/doc/terms' | relative_url }}) on this site). Scroll to the bottom and click _I Agree_.
   ![]({{ '/assets/screengrab/license.png' | relative_url }})
   
1. Then you'll see a prompt to reset your temporary password. Enter your new password and click _Change Pass Phrase_.
    ![]({{ '/assets/screengrab/password-reset.png' | relative_url }})


## Later logins

You'll see this login prompt every time you load APLS in a new browser session (that is, if you close all tabs).
If you close the tab(s) for APLS but don't close your browser completely, you can reopen APLS in a new tab without logging back in.


## Forget your password?

If you forget your password, fill out the [password-reset form][password reset]{: target="_blank"}.
We'll reset your password within 1 US business day.

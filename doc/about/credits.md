APLS exists thanks to the effort of many people over many years.
Above all others, credit belongs to the speakers who have generously shared their voices with us.

This page lists the [individuals](#contributors), [funding bodies](#funding), and [technological tools](#technological-tools) that have contributed to APLS, including the original data collection.
Foremost among the technological tools is [LaBB-CAT], which was designed and written by [Robert Fromont] and [Jen Hay] for the [New Zealand Institute of Language, Brain and Behaviour (NZILBB)][nzilbb] at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.
Further credits for LaBB-CAT can be found on APLS's [Credits page](https://apls.pitt.edu/labbcat/credits) (requires login).

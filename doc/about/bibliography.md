## Publications based on original fieldwork

{: .note .no-collapse }
> APLS includes just a subset of the audio files from this fieldwork (see the [Pittsburgh interviews]({{ '/doc/pittsburgh-interviews' | relative_url }}) page).
> As a result, specific interview excerpts discussed in these publications may not be in APLS, and specific findings discussed in these publications may not replicate in APLS.

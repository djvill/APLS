1. APLS is provided for **free, public use** for **research and educational purposes**. It may not be used for commercial purposes. It may not be used to create technology designed for policing or law enforcement.

1. APLS is **provided as-is, with no warranty**. If you discover inaccuracies in the transcripts, annotations, and/or metadata, please [notify us](mailto:apls@pitt.edu). 

1. If you present or publish research based on APLS, you must **cite APLS** with one of the [recommended citations]({{ '/doc/citing-contributing#citing-apls' | relative_url }}), including the version number.

1. If you present or publish research based on APLS, you must **[send us](mailto:apls@pitt.edu) a copy of the research**. Depending on how you used APLS data, we may ask you to [contribute back to APLS](https://djvill.github.io/APLS/doc/citing-contributing#contributing-back).

1. To access the user interface, you must log in with your user account. You **may not share your username and password** with anyone else. We may grant exceptions to create specialized user accounts for classes, demonstrations, etc.; [contact us](mailto:apls@pitt.edu) if you're interested. We reserve the right to remove user accounts that are inactive or that place excessive demands on computational resources (e.g., repeatedly downloading the full set of audio data), but we will contact users before doing do.

1. Users may download APLS data, keep it indefinitely, and make copies for the purpose of personal backup or storage. Users may privately share APLS data with individual collaborators for the purpose of research and/or educational collaboration; collaborators are also bound by these terms of use. Users may share annotations, metadata, derived data, transcript _excerpts_, and/or screenshots of the user interface publicly, so long as they do not permit readers or viewers to reconstruct substantial portions of audio data, transcripts, and/or annotations. Users may _not_ share audio data, audio excerpts, or transcripts publicly. Users may play audio excerpts for research/classroom audiences or as experimental stimuli, but may not share files to wider audiences.

1. Users **may not use web-scraping tools** to access APLS data. If you need programmatic tools for accessing APLS data, you may use APIs that LaBB-CAT provides (e.g., via the [`nzilbb.labbcat` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nzilbb.labbcat)).

1. You must **respect speakers' privacy and anonymity**. You may not attempt to identify or contact speakers. Some speech is redacted to protect speakers' privacy and anonymity; you must not attempt to circumvent redactions. If you have concerns about speakers' anonymity, please [notify us](mailto:apls@pitt.edu).

1. If these terms of use change, we will notify users and explain any changes. We may grant exceptions to these terms; please [contact us](mailto:apls@pitt.edu) if you are interested.

Finally, if anything is unclear about what you can or cannot do with APLS, please do not hesitate to contact us at apls@pitt.edu!

A <span class="keyterm">transcript</span> is a collection of <span class="keyterm">annotations</span> on numerous <span class="keyterm">layers</span> corresponding to a single audio file, plus metadata like when the audio file was originally recorded.
In APLS, each transcript has a single <span class="keyterm">main participant</span> and corresponds to a section of that participant's sociolinguistic interview.
Each transcript has its own page in APLS.

> As we'll cover [below](#accessing-transcript-pages), there are a few ways to access individual transcript pages.
> The easiest is the [_transcripts_ page]({{ '/doc/browse-transcripts' | relative_url }}) at <https://apls.pitt.edu/transcripts>. 
> Go to that page and select a transcript to view.

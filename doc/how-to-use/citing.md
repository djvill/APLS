**If you use APLS, please [cite it](#citing-apls)!**
Studies show that research software is under-cited. 
Not citing research software makes it hard for creators to gauge how often it's used, understand how to improve it, or get credit when others use it.
(Citing APLS is also part of APLS's [terms of use](terms#citation).)

In addition, if you use APLS in published research, you are obligated <!-- wording --> to [contribute back](#contributing-back) to the corpus so future fellow users can benefit.
Our goal is to make contributing back as seamless as possible.

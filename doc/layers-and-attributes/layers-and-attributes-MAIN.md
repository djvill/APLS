<span class="keyterm">Layers</span> are the backbone of what makes APLS so powerful.
They organize <span class="keyterm">annotations</span> into structured linguistic data, allowing you to [search]({{ '/doc/search' | relative_url }}) the corpus for complex patterns and [export]({{ '/doc/export-data' | relative_url }}) information about linguistic phenomena.
Since layers belong to <span class="keyterm">transcripts</span>, you can see layer annotations in context when you [view a transcript]({{ '/doc/view-transcript' | relative_url }}).

Related to layers are <span class="keyterm">attributes</span>: metadata about individual <span class="keyterm">transcripts</span> or <span class="keyterm">participants</span> in APLS (e.g., when an interview was recorded, a participant's gender).
Attributes aren't nearly as complicated as layers, but you can use them for filtering which participants/transcripts you want to search, and you can export attributes just like you export layer annotations.

The pages in this section break down how layers and attributes work:

1. A [typology of layers]({{ '/doc/layer-typology' | relative_url }}) with the fundamentals of how layers work (such as the difference between <span class="keyterm">word layers</span> and <span class="keyterm">segment layers</span>) and how you can interact with them in APLS.
1. A rundown of [layer notation systems]({{ '/doc/layer-notation-systems' | relative_url }}) so you can decode the symbols that different layers use, such as the [DISC phonemic alphabet]({{ '/doc/layer-notation-systems#disc-phonemic-alphabet' | relative_url }}).
1. A [typology of attributes]({{ '/doc/attribute-typology' | relative_url }}) that breaks down how attributes work.
1. Detailed [field guides]({{ '/doc/detailed-field-guides' | relative_url }}) that contain all the information you need to know about each layer and attribute.
1. [Quick reference cards]({{ '/doc/quick-reference-cards' | relative_url }}) that are useful for refreshing your memory about how each layer and attribute works.

[As a reminder]({{ '/doc/doc-navigation#special-formatting' | relative_url }}), text formatted with a dotted underline, like <span class="layer">dictionary_phonemes</span>, refers to a layer or attribute.
If you hover over a layer/attribute name, a tooltip will pop up with a short description of the layer/attribute.
Clicking on the name will load its field guide entry.

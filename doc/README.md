# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation homepage for the **Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech** (aka **APLS**, pronounced like _apples_)!
APLS is a free linguistic data resource, containing recordings of interviews conducted with speakers native to Pittsburgh and surrounding neighborhoods.
APLS is currently under construction, but when complete, it will contain 270 sound files totaling 45 hours of audio from 40 speakers.

These recordings are transcribed and annotated with numerous [layers](doc/layer-reference) of linguistic information at the level of phrases, words, and individual speech sounds.
Powered by the linguistic corpus software [LaBB-CAT](https://sourceforge.net/projects/labbcat/), APLS allows users to:

- [search](doc/search) for complex linguistic patterns
- [extract](doc/export-data) data tables of individual tokens to CSV files
- [export](doc/download-transcript) transcripts in a variety of common formats
- [perform](doc/extract-acoustics) batch acoustic measurements
- and other tasks

   Turn keyterm/layer <span>s into links by adding <a> child
   
   !!TODO:
   For keyterms, facilitate "In context" backlinks (in doc/glossary) by adding
   keyterm-<TERM> ID to:
   - The token of <TERM> with class term-anchor (if any), OR
   - The first token of <TERM> (if none are .term-anchor)
   This facilitates pointing the backlink to a specific token.
   If >1 token of <TERM> is .term-anchor, an error is thrown

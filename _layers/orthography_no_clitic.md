### Notes

A word are tagged only if its **orthography** annotation ends in the following: _'s_, _s'_, _'d_, _'ll_, _'ve_, _'d've_, _'ll've_.
Otherwise, words are un-tagged (meaning the large majority of words are un-tagged).

This layer exists solely to provide data for the **dictionary_phonemes** layer.


### Downstream layers

Used by **phonemes_no_clitic** for looking up phonemic representations of base forms.
Used by **dictionary_phonemes** for tagging phonemic representations of cliticized forms.
